# Artificial Intelligence

## Course Overview

- **Objective** The primary objective of this course is to introduce knowledge representation, problem solving and learning methods of Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, students will be learning how to apply such techniques into  games.
- **Expectation** Students are expected to have Java programming background as the entire course will be primary taught in Java. In addtion, students are expected to devote a large amount of time learning how to implement algorithms learned in class.

## Logistics

- **Instructor** Hsiang-Yu (Eric) Liao and John J. Tran
- **Lecture** Saturday 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM
- **Office Hours** Saturday 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM
- **Location** E&T A126
- **Text Book** None as we will have more notes hosted on Github.

## Course Objectives

* Knowledge Representation (Graph, Node and Edge)
* Brute force searching algorithm (DFS & BFS)
* Heuristic searching algorithm (A*)
* Alpha-Beta pruning
* Min-Max

## Grading Allocation

1. Quiz (4) 40 pts
2. Homework (4) 40 pts
3. Course Project 20 pts

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project: a complete application/game that utilizes the AI theories. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
* B+: 85 to 89
* B: 80 to 84  
**Graduate students are required to obtain a grade 80 or above to pass the course**
* B-: 77 to 79
* C+: 74 to 76
* C: 70 to 73  
**Undergraduate students are required to obtain a grade 70 or above to pass the course**

## ADA Statement

Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with the Office of Students with Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.

## Academic Integrity

Cheating on assignments and exams will not be tolerated. All parties involved will receive a grade of **F** for the course and be reported to the Computer Science Department.
