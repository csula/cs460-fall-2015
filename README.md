## Announcements

* Due to some confusions on Github/Git usage, here is [an article talking about Git/Github written from myself](documents/misc/github-tutorial.md).
* We just got the discount from Github education for private repositories. Therefore, on next class your current repository will be replaced by another private repository.


## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone/fork repository
2. Run `gradle check` to run through all the unit tests
3. Run `gradle clean build` to build project
4. [WIP] Run `gradle run` for running project
